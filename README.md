# PAMM
Simulation files including R code

Within each of the folders below, we have simulate datasets under 8 different scenarios and analyze them.

The folders each include the R project file, which can be first opened. 
Then the script can be opened.

Generating the simulated data are slower for certain conditions, and analyzing them for 500 datasets under 8 scenarios can take a long time (up to a couple days for the conditional gap-time data, for example).

The simulated data (simdat) as well as the analysis results (dat) is already saved in the workspace file. We recommend loading the workspace and then evaluating the simulated data.
